# Diabetes Diagnostic Prediction Model [Advanced Statistics]
Diabetes Diagnistic Prediction Model with Diabetes Health Indicators from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

# Advanced Statistics Final Project. CDC Diabetes Health Indicators.
## Description.
The dataset contains health care statistics and survey information about people's lifestyle in general, along with their diabetes diagnosis. The 21 features consist of some demographic data, lab test results, and answers to survey questions for each patient.
## Content Summary.
- Each observation represents a patient.

- Diabetes diagnosis

- Demographics (gender)

- Personal information (income, education)

- Health history (alcohol use, smoking, mental health, physical health)

#### We have 253,680 observations
## Goal.
To better understand the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes in the US.
The target variable for classification is whether a patient:

- Has diabetes. (Diabetes, 2)

A simplification can be seen below:

*0 = no diabetes, 1 = prediabetes or diabetes
